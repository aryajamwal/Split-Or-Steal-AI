Hello everyone, this project of mine is about the prisoners dilemma and game theory, what inspired me to do this project was from a Veratasium video, i was spektical about how 'game theory' would be so vital for life and the human race, but after watching the video I was deeply enlightened, one could say, so I decided to make this website about the same. As I am writing this, I am hoping to make this a multiplayer game but I am not sure if it would work as i think it would.
